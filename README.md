# Personal Portfolio (MSA Phase 3 Frontend)

Always wanted one of these, so took the chance to make my own.

## Phase 3 Features
- UI scalability (e.g. project card size and text size scales, everything else scales) 
- Mobile first development (*lots* of screen size break points all around)
- Storybook with action and intereaction (interaction test on nav bar button, contact form, action on RoundedButton, nav bar)
- Fluid animation (smooth scrolling on nav bar click, loading button for contact form)
- Redux state management (all states in the app uses Redux, example in contact form and mobile nav bar)
